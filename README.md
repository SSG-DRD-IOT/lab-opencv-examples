## OpenCV Examples 

At this part of the excercises for Industrial IoT, we will try to cover the basic principles of visual computing using OpenCV, and some practices to use OpenCV Python library with Python Notebooks.

Many times instead of raw presentations, better to start experiments directly hands on and learn.

As per Industrial IoT Workshops, UP2 boards are already Jupyter notebook servers, so you need to connect to UP2 board with its IP address from your browser:

http:\\<up2_board_ip_address>:8888

When prompted as below image, write **upsquared** for password.

And navigate to: /home/upsquared/Desktop/Lab\ Answers/lab-opencv-examples

Your image might be out dated so clone this repository to your choice of folder after connecting with ssh.

`shell
$ git clone 
`

Now, let's follow below examples to learn more about visual computing.
